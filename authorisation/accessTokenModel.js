/* This method returns the client application which is attempting to get the accessToken.
 The client is normally be found using the  clientID & clientSecret. However, with user facing client applications such
 as mobile apps or websites which use the password grantType we don't use the clientID or clientSecret in the authentication flow.
 Therefore, although the client  object is required by the library all of the client's fields can be  be null. This also
includes the grants field. Note that we did, however, specify that we're using the password grantType when we made the
oAuth object in the index.js file.

The callback takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is an error of type falsey and the second is a client object.
As we're not of retrieving the client using the clientID and clientSecret (as we're using the password grantType)
we can just create an empty client with all null values.Because the client is a hardcoded object
 - as opposed to a client we've retrieved through another operation - we just pass false for the error parameter
  as no errors can occur due to the aforemtioned hardcoding */

/* This method is called when a user is using a bearerToken they've already got as authentication
   i.e. when they're calling APIs. The method effectively serves to validate the bearerToken. A bearerToken
   has been successfully validated if passing it to the getUserIDFromBearerToken() method returns a userID.
   It's able to return a userID because each row in the access_tokens table has a userID in it so we can use
   the bearerToken to query for a row which will have a userID in it.

   The callback takes 2 parameters:
   1. A truthy boolean indicating whether or not an error has occured. It should be set to a truthy if
   there is an error or a falsy if there is no error
   2. An accessToken which contains an expiration date, you can assign null to ensure the token doesnin't expire.
  Then either a user object, or a userId which is a string or a number.

  If you create a user object you can access it in authenticated endpoints in the req.user object.
  If you create a userId you can access it in authenticated endpoints in the req.user.id object.
